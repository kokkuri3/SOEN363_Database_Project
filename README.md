## Description
This database project models a car rental service in which customers can browse available vehicles and create reservations.

The database implementation platform that we used was MySQL.

Two datasets were outsourced in order to populate tables.
- For the car table: [Automobile Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tawfikelmetwally/automobile-dataset/data)
- For the user table: [Car Sales Price Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yashpaloswal/ann-car-sales-price-prediction)
